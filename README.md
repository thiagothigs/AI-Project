# Visual Speech Recognition Using Optical Flow and Artificial Neural Networks

This project proposes an visual speech recognition method using lip movement extracted from a video measured by optical flow to attempt to increase robustness in noise environments. To perform the speech recognition, an artificial neural network is used with multilayer feed forward architecture with back propagation learning algorithm. Experiments were conducted using Portuguese isolated digit speech using visual information only extracted from videos. Recognition accuracy achieved for speech recognition tests using visual information
only is about 79%.
